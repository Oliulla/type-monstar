                        <h5>Differences between localStorage and sessionStorage</h5>
                        <p>
                            Both the localStorage and the sessionStorage are Web API. And both are almost simillar
                            but there are some differences between them. One major difference is the localStorage
                            data doesn't expire even though user close the browser on the other hand the sessionStorage 
                            data being expired even user close the tab as well as browser.

                        <h5>Differences between global scope and block scope in JavaScript</h5>
                        <p>
                            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are 
                            known as global variables and have global scope
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined 
                            as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly 
                            brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. 
                            You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
