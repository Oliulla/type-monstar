                        <h5>Differences between localStorage and sessionStorage</h5>
                        <p>
                            Both the localStorage and the sessionStorage are Web API. And both are almost simillar
                            but there are some differences between them. One major difference is the localStorage
                            data doesn't expire even though user close the browser on the other hand the sessionStorage 
                            data being expired even user close the tab as well as browser.

                        <h5>Differences between global scope and block scope in JavaScript</h5>
                        <p>
                            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are 
                            known as global variables and have global scope. It could be refer from any scope.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined 
                            as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly 
                            brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. 
                            You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                        <h5>How JavaScript event loop works</h5>
                        <p>
                            The Event Loop monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. 
                            If the Call Stack is being empty, then the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and 
                            will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                        <h5>How many ways we can get undefined in JavaScript</h5>
                        <p>
                            <em>Lets see 8 ways to get undefined</em>: (1) Variable that is no initialized will give undefined.
                            (2) Function with no return. (3) Parameters that is not passed will be undefined. (4) If return
                            has nothing on the right side. (5) Property that doesn't exists on an object will give undefined.
                            (6) Accessing array elements outside of the index range. (7) Deleting an element inside an array.
                            (8) Set a value directly undefined.
